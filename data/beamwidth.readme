Power is measured in mW, position in mm

Data was taken using the knife edge technique, slowly uncovering a beam with a razor blade and having it hit a power detector. As more and more of the beam is uncovered,
we are effectively taking the integral under the beam's intensity profile. By measuring the power as we uncover the beam, we can plot power as a function of position, then
take the DERIVATIVE of that graph to find the beam profile.
